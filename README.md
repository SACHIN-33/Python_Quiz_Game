We define a run_quiz function that contains a list questions with 5 dictionaries, each representing a question, options, and correct answer.
The quiz iterates through each question, presents the options, takes user input, and checks if the answer is correct.
At the end of the quiz, it calculates and displays the user's score.
You can run this script in a Python environment to play the quiz game based on Tamil Nadu. Adjustments can be made to the questions, options, and answers as per your preference.
